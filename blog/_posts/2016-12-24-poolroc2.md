In the previous post, I proposed an method for pooling multiple ranked list from model-based probability estimations. The method was applicable when we have a binary classification task for a certain data set, with it being partitioned into multiple subsets, and different classification models built for each subset. Usually, this happens when we assume some clustering structure among observations in the original data set, and decide that it is the best to fit different classification models within each data set - an idea analogous to the concept of mixture modeling. 

In this post, I would like to discuss another problem of pooling for binary classification models. When we have multiple classification models for the same data set, each of which produce a different probabilistic ranking of all observations in the data set, how should we pool model results in order to get the optimal ranking of all observations? Notice that in this case, we do not partition the data set into subset; each model is applied to the entire data set. As a result, for each observation, we have multiple estimates from different models, and we would like to combine all the different estimates together in order to produce a score that can provide the best ranking among observations.

This problem is closely linked to the concept of Ensemble Modeling, or [Ensemble Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning), a very common strategy used in predictive modeling. The idea is that when we have different algorithms used for the same classification task. Rather than picking one "dictator" algorithm and disregard all the other algorithms, we would like to run a "poll" on the results of all different algorithms and produce a "democratic" result. This hopefully can reduce the prediction variability of using one single algorithm. In practice, ensembling methods are vastly useful. If you have [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) competition experience, you must be conviced of this strategy.
