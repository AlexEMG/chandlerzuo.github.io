It is contraversial to draw the comparison between Christiano Ronaldo and Leo Messi, both of whom are God created soccer talents -- until The Economist published [this article](http://www.economist.com/blogs/gametheory/2015/03/statistical-analysis-football). The author compared the total goals achieved by each person during the 2013-2014 season, weighted each goal by a score representing its value. Based on this method, although Ronaldo shot more goals in the season, the total value of them is less than Messi. As a result, the article concluded that Leo Messi was the more valuable player -- simply put, better.

As a Real Madrid fan, I could not help but start to evaluate the author's methodology critically. Kind enough, The Economist published [the data](http://infographics.economist.com//2015/databank/MessivsRonaldo.xls) it used.
